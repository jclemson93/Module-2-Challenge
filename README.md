Challenge #2
With a brief look at the new analysis, we are able to see that this macro can provide us with way more information than before. In the first iteration, it only showed the "Ticker", "Total Daily Volume", and "Return Percentage" for the 2018 Stock Data. With our update to the code, we now have the starting price and ending price output to our table. These two rows looks at the ending price of the first day and last day to get these two values. This is due to stocks being calculated at the end of each business day. We were able to do this by initializing several arays outside our previous For loop to hold the data for these variables. Within our previous For loop, we were able to store the ending price and starting price to our additional arrays.

We can see that two stocks were profitable, RUN and ENPH. Four other stocks were slightly in the red at under 10% while 6 other stocks were in the red from -16.3% all the way to 62.6%.
